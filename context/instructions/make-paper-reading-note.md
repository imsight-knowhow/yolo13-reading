you are tasked to read a paper and create a structured note summarizing its key aspects. Use the following template to ensure all important elements are captured. If user does not specify an output dir, save the note in dir `notes/<paper-name>/`, name the output markdown as `main-note.md`, and store any images in a subdir `figures/`. Ensure all image paths in the markdown are relative to the markdown file location.

formatting guide:
- for bulleted lists, format it like "- **Item**: description"

citation guide:
- to ground your note, include blockquote snippets from the paper with proper citations

below is the template
