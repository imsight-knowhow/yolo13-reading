## Overview
This directory organizes project knowledge, plans, logs, and aids for effective AI collaboration. It follows the structure from `magic-context/general/context-dir-guide.md`.

## Structure

- `plans/` — Roadmaps and implementation strategies
- `refcode/` — Reference implementations and examples
- `roles/` — Role prompts and memory (per persona)
- `summaries/` — Knowledge summaries and analyses
- `tasks/` — Tracked work items (features/fixes/refactor/tests)
- `tools/` — Project-specific utilities and scripts

## Quick Start
- Add documents using the HEADER block (purpose/status/date/dependencies/target)
- Use naming patterns from the guide (e.g., date-prefixed logs)
- Keep documents current and link them from project docs when helpful
