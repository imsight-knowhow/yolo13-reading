The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13‑N improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11‑N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12‑N.

% In recent years, the YOLO series has emerged as the dominant framework for real‑time object detection, thanks to its exceptional detection accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the pure convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier models, as well as the area‑based self‑attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12, still fail to fully capture the intricate, many‑to‑many high‑order semantic associations present in complex scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose YOLOv13, which markedly enhances representational richness and detection performance through efficient high‑order visual association modeling driven by soft hypergraphs. First, our Soft Hypergraph‑based Visual Association Capturing (HyperVAC) module employs learnable soft hyperedges to dynamically construct high‑order associations across spatial positions and cross scales, and leverages a linear‑complexity message‑passing mechanism to efficiently aggregate many‑to‑many interactions. Building on this, the Full‑Pipeline Aggregation‑Distribution (FullPAD) mechanism, centered on HyperVAC, uniformly aggregates multi‑level features from the backbone within the hypergraph space and redistributes the enhanced features throughout the Backbone, Neck, and Detection Head, thereby achieving fine‑grained information flow and representational synergy across the entire network. Finally, by replacing all large‑kernel convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions, we significantly reduce model parameters and computational overhead without sacrificing any performance. On the MSCOCO benchmark, our method consistently outperforms previous YOLOs: in particular, our YOLOv13‑S improves mAP by XX\% over YOLO11‑S and by XX\% over YOLOv12‑S.
