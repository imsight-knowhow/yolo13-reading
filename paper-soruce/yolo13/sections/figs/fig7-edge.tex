    \caption{Visualization of adaptive hyperedges. The hyperedges in the first and second columns mainly focus on the high-order interactions among objects in the foreground. The third column mainly focuses on the interactions between the background and the foreground targets. The visualization of these adaptive hyperedges can intuitively reflect the high-order visual correlations modeled by our YOLOv13.}
