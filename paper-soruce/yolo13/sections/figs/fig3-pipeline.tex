    \caption{The network architecture of our proposed YOLOv13 model. Taking multi-scale features extracted from the backbone as input, HyperACE adaptively explores high-order correlations and achieves feature enhancement and fusion. Then, the correlation-enhanced features are distributed to the entire network by FullPAD tunnels to achieve accurate object detection in complex scenes. The detailed structure of HyperACE is shown on the right.
    % The right part is the structure of the Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism. The upper right shows the C3AH used in HyperACE.
