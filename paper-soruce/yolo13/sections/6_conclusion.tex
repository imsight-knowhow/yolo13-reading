\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, the state-of-the-art end-to-end real-time object detector. A hypergraph-based adaptive correlation enhancement mechanism is proposed to adaptively explore latent global high-order correlations and achieve multi-scale feature fusion and enhancement based on correlation guidance. The correlation-enhanced features are distributed throughout the entire network by the proposed full-pipeline aggregation-and-distribution paradigm, effectively promoting information flow and achieving accurate object detection. In addition, a series of blocks based on depthwise separable convolution are proposed, which can significantly reduce the number of parameters and FLOPs while maintaining accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO dataset. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational complexity.
